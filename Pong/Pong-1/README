Update 1 focuses on setting up a virtual resolution using the push library and changing how things are rendered by Love2D. We also learn how to detect user input and change
the filter that is applied when rendering.

In this update I:
- Imported the Push library
- Setup virtual rendering using Push
- Changed the graphics filter used by Love2D to Point or 'Nearest' filtering
- Added a function for detecting user input
- Added functionality for terminating the game if the 'escape' key is pressed
