Update 2 focuses on learning how to import new fonts, apply those new fonts, and how to draw primitive shapes on the screen using Love2D's graphics library and coordinate
system.

In this update I:
- Imported the font file used in the EDX example
- Created font in Love2D using font file
- Applied new font as default font
- Started clearing screen when drawing each frame to update what is displayed
- Defined variables for paddle and ball sizes
- Set the draw color to make things look less bland
- Printed 'This is Pong' near the top of the screen in the new font
- Drew two paddles near opposite corners of the screen
- Drew a ball in the middle of the screen
