Update 3 focuses on detecting inputs and allowing for user interaction as well as learning how to
apply inputs when drawing graphics to update where objects are on screen.

In this update I:
- Cleaned up the code to be more readable and organized
- Moved all variables to the load function to avoid redefining them every frame
- Created a new font for the score
- Defined new variables for paddle and ball positions, paddle speed, and player scores
- Added function for drawing player scores on each side of the screen
- Created the update function
- Created if statements for detecting player input through w, s, up, and down keys
- Applied paddle speed to paddle positions depending on what input is pressed
- Added frames per second counter in the top left for fun
