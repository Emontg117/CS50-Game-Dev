In Update 4 we learn how to make use of game states as well as how to work with velocity and apply it to objects
in our game. We also make use of lua's math library to generate random numbers and define minimum and maximum values

In this update I:
- Added more comments to make things more clear
- Initialize math.randomseed using the system time of the computer
- Use math.min() and math.max() to confine paddles to the screen
- Use math.random() to add random velocity to the ball when the game starts
- Define new variables for ball velocity
- Add ball velocity to ball position every frame and multiply it by delta time to keep things consistent
- Define two game states: start and play
- During start the game is paused, all values are reset to defaults, and a new velocity is generated for the ball
- During play the game is unpaused, values can change, and the players can interact with the game
- The return (enter) key can be used to switch between these states
